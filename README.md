# GEMATMW FINAL PROJECT
Hello! This will be our repository for making our group project for GEMATMW. Please be sure to read the README before doing anything. Thanks!

Some Guidelines to Follow:
1. Whenever you commit to this repository, please be sure to update the changelog so that everyone knows what was revised and/or added to the source code.
2. Please strictly do internal documentation for your code. This is to make things easier to read for everyone. Whenever you make a function or a loop per se, write a description so everyone knows what it means -- no need to do manual tracing.
3. Please write your name on functions you create for easier debugging.
4. Make it a good habit to keep backup of local files. (Just in case)
5. Do consult with the group when making huge decisions.
